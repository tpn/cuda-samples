      Software License Agreement for NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit

IMPORTANT NOTICE -- READ CAREFULLY: This Software License Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) for NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit, including computer software and associated documentation (&quot;Software&quot;), is the Agreement which governs use of the SOFTWARE of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries (&quot;NVIDIA&quot;) downloadable herefrom. By downloading, installing, copying, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE, You (as defined below) agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If You do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not download the SOFTWARE. 

RECITALS 

Use of NVIDIA&apos;s SOFTWARE requires three elements: the SOFTWARE, an NVIDIA GPU or application processor (&quot;NVIDIA Hardware&quot;), and a computer system. The SOFTWARE is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The SOFTWARE is not sold, and instead is only licensed for Your use, strictly in accordance with this Agreement. The NVIDIA Hardware is protected by various patents, and is sold, but this Agreement does not cover the sale or use of such hardware, since it may not necessarily be sold as a package with the SOFTWARE. This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of the SOFTWARE only. 

1. DEFINITIONS 

1.1 &quot;Licensee,&quot; &quot;You,&quot; or &quot;Your&quot; shall mean the entity or individual that downloads and uses the SOFTWARE. 

1.2 &quot;Redistributable SOFTWARE&quot; shall mean the redistributable libraries referenced in Attachment A of this Agreement.

1.3 &quot;SOFTWARE&quot; shall mean the deliverables provided pursuant to this Agreement. 

2. GRANT OF LICENSE 

2.1 Rights and Limitations of Grant. Provided that Licensee complies with the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants Licensee the following limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except as expressly permitted otherwise for Redistributable Software in Sections 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 of this Agreement) right to use the SOFTWARE, with the following limitations: 

2.1.1 Usage Rights. Licensee may install and use multiple copies of the SOFTWARE on a shared computer or concurrently on different computers, and make multiple back-up copies of the SOFTWARE, solely for Licensee&apos;s use within Licensee&apos;s Enterprise. &quot;Enterprise&quot; shall mean individual use by Licensee or any legal entity (such as a corporation or university) and the subsidiaries it owns by more than 50 percent.

2.1.2 Redistribution Rights.  Licensee may transfer, redistribute, and sublicense certain files of the Redistributable SOFTWARE, as defined in Attachment A of this Agreement, provided, however, that (a) the Redistributable SOFTWARE shall be distributed solely in binary form to Licensee&apos;s licensees (&quot;Customers&quot;) only as a component of Licensee&apos;s own software products (each, a &quot;Licensee Application&quot;); (b) Licensee shall design the Licensee Application such that the Redistributable SOFTWARE files are installed only in a private (non-shared) directory location that is used only by the Licensee Application; (c) Licensee shall obtain each Customer&apos;s written or clickwrap agreement to the license terms under a written, legally enforceable agreement that has the effect of protecting the SOFTWARE and the rights of NVIDIA under terms no less restrictive than this Agreement.    

2.1.3 Further Redistribution Rights. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Licensee may authorize Customers to further redistribute the Redistributable SOFTWARE that such Customers receive as part of the Licensee Application, solely in binary form, provided, however, that Licensee shall require in their standard software license agreements with Customers that all such redistributions must be made pursuant to a license agreement that has the effect of protecting the SOFTWARE and the rights of NVIDIA whose terms and conditions are at least as restrictive as those in the applicable Licensee software license agreement covering the Licensee Application. For avoidance of doubt, termination of this Agreement shall not affect rights previously granted by Licensee to its Customers under this Agreement to the extent validly granted to Customers under Section 2.1.2. 

2.1.4 Linux/FreeBSD Exception. Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of Sections 2.1.1, 2.1.2 and 2.1.3, SOFTWARE designed exclusively for use on the Linux or FreeBSD operating systems, or other operating systems derived from the source code to these operating systems, may be copied and redistributed, provided that the binary files thereof are not modified in any way (except for unzipping of compressed files). 

2.1.5 Additional Licensing Obligations

Licensee acknowledges and agrees that its use of certain third party components included with the SOFTWARE may be subject to additional licensing terms and conditions as set forth or referenced in Attachment B of this Agreement.

2.1.6 Limitations 

No Reverse Engineering. Licensee may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE, nor attempt in any other manner to obtain the source code. 

No Separation of Components. The SOFTWARE is licensed as a single product.  Except as authorized in this Agreement, Software component parts of the Software may not be separated for use on more than one computer, nor otherwise used separately from the other parts. 

No Rental. Licensee may not rent or lease the SOFTWARE to someone else. 

3. TERM AND TERMINATION

Notwithstanding any Non-Disclosure Agreement executed by and between the parties, the parties agree that in the event Licensee or NVIDIA provides Feedback (as defined below) to the other party   on how to design, implement, or improve the SOFTWARE or Licensee&apos;s product(s) for use with the SOFTWARE, the following terms and conditions apply the Feedback:

7.1.1 Exchange of Feedback. Both parties agree that neither party has an obligation to give the other party any suggestions, comments or other feedback, whether verbally or in written or source code form, relating to (i) the SOFTWARE; (ii) Licensee&apos;s products; (iii) Licensee&apos;s use of the SOFTWARE; or (iv) optimization/interoperability of  Licensee&apos;s product with the SOFTWARE (collectively defined as &quot;Feedback&quot;).  In the event either party provides Feedback to the other party, the party receiving the Feedback may use any Feedback that the other party voluntarily provides to improve the (i) SOFTWARE or other related NVIDIA technologies, respectively for the benefit of NVIDIA; or (ii) Licensee&apos;s product or other related Licensee technologies, respectively for the benefit of Licensee.  Accordingly, if either party provides Feedback to the other party, both parties agree that the other party and its respective licensees may freely use, reproduce, license, distribute, and otherwise commercialize the Feedback in the (i) SOFTWARE or other related technologies; or (ii) Licensee&apos;s products or other related technologies, respectively, without the payment of any royalties or fees.

7.1.2 Residual Rights. Licensee agrees that NVIDIA shall be free to use any general knowledge, skills and experience, (including, but not limited to, ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques) (&quot;Residuals&quot;), contained in the (i) Feedback provided by Licensee to NVIDIA; (ii) Licensee&apos;s products shared or disclosed to NVIDIA in connection with the Feedback; or (c) Licensee&apos;s confidential information voluntarily provided to NVIDIA in connection with the Feedback, which are retained in the memories of NVIDIA&apos;s employees, agents, or contractors who have had access to such Residuals.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, NVIDIA&apos;s employees, agents, or contractors shall not be prevented from using Residuals as part of such employee&apos;s, agent&apos;s or contractor&apos;s general knowledge, skills, experience, talent, and/or expertise.  NVIDIA shall not have any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of such employees, agents or contractors or to pay royalties for any work resulting from the use of Residuals.

7.1.3 Disclaimer of Warranty. FEEDBACK FROM EITHER PARTY IS PROVIDED FOR THE OTHER PARTY&apos;S USE &quot;AS IS&quot; AND BOTH PARTIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED AND STATUTORY INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT.  BOTH PARTIES DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE FEEDBACK WILL MEET THE OTHER PARTY&apos;S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEEDBACK WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.

7.2 Freedom of Action.  Licensee agrees that this Agreement is nonexclusive and NVIDIA may currently or in the future be developing software, other technology or confidential information internally, or receiving confidential information from other parties that maybe similar to the Feedback and Licensee&apos;s confidential information (as provided in Section 7.1.2 above), which may be provided to NVIDIA in connection with Feedback by Licensee.  Accordingly, Licensee agrees that nothing in this Agreement will be construed as a representation or inference that NVIDIA will not develop, design, manufacture, acquire, market products, or have products developed, designed, manufactured, acquired, or marketed for NVIDIA, that compete with the Licensee&apos;s products or confidential information.

7.3 No Implied Licenses.  Under no circumstances should anything in this Agreement be construed as NVIDIA granting by implication, estoppel or otherwise, (i) a license to any NVIDIA product or technology other than the SOFTWARE; or (ii) any additional license rights for the SOFTWARE other than the licenses expressly granted in this Agreement.

7.4 If any provision of this  Agreement is inconsistent with, or cannot be fully enforced under, the law, such provision will be construed as limited to the extent necessary to be consistent with and fully enforceable under the law.
